The critical path goes from one of the bits of input A to one of the bits of output S (total delay 0.50 ns).
Carry generation requires 0.41 ns.
	The signal passes through:
		- PG block of stage 0.
		- G block of stage 1.
		- G block of stage 2.
		- G block of stage 3.
		- G block of stage 4.
		And then exits the carry generator.
Sum generation requires 0.09 ns.
	The signal passes through:
		- The SEL port of the MUX21_GENERIC.
		- The internal logic of the MUX.
		And then exits the sum generator.
This is expected since, in the worst case, carry generation requires a signal to pass through log2(n)+1 G/PG block stages,
while sum generation only requires a signal to pass through 1 adder + 1 mux (in this case only thorugh the mux).
